# Repository Created! Now Push Your Code

## The remote is already set up. Just push:

git push -u origin main
```

If you need to create the repository first:
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `kanban`
3. Don't initialize with README
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Then run: `git push -u origin main`
